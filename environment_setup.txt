The directory is divided into some parts. All csv files and jsonl files are categorized 
and divided within the `data` subdirectory under corresponding name targets:
- CRU's LST data: `data/CRU`
- CDC's ILI data: `data/ILI`
- IMF's GDP data: `data/`
- Zillow Housing data: `data/housing`

All code is hosted within the code subdirectory. Some sample baselines are in
subdirectories with an `xgboost` prefix. 

To execute a complete training pipeline, you can simply execute `main.sh` or
each of the individual scripts from the `code` directory that are listed in 
`main.sh`.

All primary code ranging from data handling and preprocessing, to prompt creation, 
to inference, to evaluation, to general exploration are hosted inside of the `code`
subdirectory.
