The code environment assumes running on python 3.8 or higher and the environment is configured
with Python 3.10. 

We highly recommend installing Anaconda or Miniconda and configuring the code within a Conda 
environment to run all experiments most effectively and efficiently without having to install 
any packages native to the machine. 

The user guide for conda installation can be found here: 
https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html

Download the most updated stable release of conda for your OS (we assume some form of Unix or Linux
base - ie a Linux or MacOS native machine) for best use. 

Then, once conda is configured, you should run the following command to configure an environment
based on the provided `environment.yml` file in the base directory:
`conda env create -f environment.yml`

To check that the environment was made, you should see an environment titled `cs325` if you run
`conda env list`. 

To activate the conda environment, run:
`conda activate cs325`
