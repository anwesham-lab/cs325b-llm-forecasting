## Contribtutors:
Authors: Anwesha Mukherjee, Shreyas Lakhtakia, Medhanie Irgau, Rohin Manvi
Course Staff: Stefano Ermon, David Lobell, Marshall Burke, Angela Tsao, Christos Polzak

## Environment and Installation:
Read `installation_setup.txt` followed by `environment_setup.txt`
Rather than a `requirements.txt` file, we use a `environment.yml` file and recommend installation of 
Conda for python3. 

## Instructions:
Run the shell scripts as explained in `run_instructions.txt`. We need multiple scripts instead of just one main.sh because of our dependence on OpenAI's server (e.g. waiting on finetuning response).
